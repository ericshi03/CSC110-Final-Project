# Vulnerability Score Calculator

In this project we aim to answer the question "Which industries are must vulnerable during the pandemic?". 

To accomplish this, we analyze several datasets which pertain to the hiring rate, revenue, and stock price during the period from 2018-2020.

After reading in said datasets, a vulnerability score will be calculated based off of the values found.

We will then plot our vulnerability score against our datasets to display the trend.
